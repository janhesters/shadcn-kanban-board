## Features

- üé® Seamless Theming: automatically adapts to your [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) color scheme
- üîÑ Framework-Agnostic: works with local state, [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com) actions, or [Next.js Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) ...
- üß© Extensible APIs: register custom DnD monitors and announcement handlers for fine-grained control

## Motivation

We needed a good Kanban board for our LinkedIn scheduling and employee advocacy app, [SocialKit](https://getsocialkit.com/). We're building the app with Shadcn/UI and couldn‚Äôt find a Kanban board that was accessible, themeable, and easy to use. So we built our own.

## Example

Check out the [example page](https://github.com/janhesters/shadcn-kanban-board/blob/main/app/routes/example.tsx). It demonstrates:

- **Provider & layout**: Wraps everything in `KanbanBoardProvider` and sets up `<KanbanBoard>` inside your page.
- **Dynamic columns & cards**: Uses `createId()` from `@paralleldrive/cuid2` to generate stable IDs.
- **Add / remove**: Add or delete columns and cards, with auto-scroll to keep the latest column in view.
- **Inline editing**: Edit column titles and card titles in place via `<Input>` and `<Textarea>`.
- **Drag & drop**: Full mouse & keyboard DnD powered by `useDndEvents()`, including space/enter to pick up & drop, arrow keys to move, escape to cancel.
- **Skeleton & JS-load guard**: Shows a `<KanbanBoardColumnSkeleton>` via `useJsLoaded()` until client-side JS is ready.
- **Accessibility**: Screen-reader announcements on drag events, focus management, and ARIA labels everywhere.
- **Theming & colors**: Color-circle primitives (`KanbanColorCircle`) driven by your theme‚Äôs CSS vars.
- **Menus & icons**: Per-column dropdown (edit/delete) with `lucide-react` icons, tooltips, and `<DropdownMenu>`.

Between the hooks, primitives and UX details (autoscroll, autofocus, multi-line card support), it‚Äôs a complete pattern you can lift straight into your own app. Just paste in `KanbanBoardPage` and go.
