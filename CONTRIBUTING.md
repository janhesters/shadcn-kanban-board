## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our code of conduct. Please be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps outlined in the main [README.md](./README.md#getting-started).

## Issue Workflow

1. **Create an issue** describing your proposed feature or bug fix. Include:
   * A clear title
   * Description of the problem or feature
   * Relevant context (screenshots, logs, examples)
2. **Get approval** from one of the maintainers (the ReactSquad team) before opening a pull request, so you don't waste time on a pull request that won't be merged.
3. Once approved, proceed to implement the changes in a new branch.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature/fix branch** off of `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
   ```
2. **Implement your changes**, adhering to the [Style Guide](#style-guide).
3. **Write tests** (see [Testing Guidelines](#testing-guidelines)).
4. **Run checks**:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck    # Type checking
   npm run lint         # Linting
   npm run test         # Unit & integration tests
   npm run test:e2e:ui  # End-to-end tests
   ```
5. **Commit changes** following our [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines).

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clarity and automated versioning. Commit message format:

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `style`: Code style (formatting)
* `refactor`: Code restructuring
* `test`: Adding or updating tests
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

After staging, use Commitizen for consistent formatting:

```bash
npx cz
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Open a pull request against `reactsquad/main`.
4. **Link the approved issue** in your PR description.
5. Ensure all checks pass and the build is green.
6. Request review from at least one maintainer.
7. Address feedback; maintainers may request commit squashing.

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Location

* **Tests live adjacent to implementation files**, for example:

  ```text
  src/components/Button.tsx
  src/components/Button.test.tsx
  ```

### Coverage Requirements

* **New features** must include tests at the appropriate level: unit, integration, component, or E2E.
* **Bug fixes** require a reproducible failing test first. Once the test fails, implement the fix so the test passes.

### Test Style

Follow the projectâ€™s testing conventions:

* **Prose style**: `given: ... should: ...`
* **Assertions**: `expect(actual).toEqual(expected)`
* See [5 Questions Every Test Must Answer](https://medium.com/@ericelliott/5-questions-every-test-must-answer-18a03194eeb1).

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test        # Unit & integration
npm run test:e2e:ui # End-to-end
```

## Style Guide

### TypeScript

* Use strict mode
* Define explicit return types
* Favor `type` for object shapes

### React

* Functional components with hooks
* Follow React Router patterns
* Use React Hook Form for forms
* Implement error boundaries

### Styling

* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui component system
* Maintain dark mode support

### File Structure & Naming

* All files must be named in `kebab-case`.
* All constants must be named in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

### Code Quality

* ESLint & Prettier
* Write self-documenting code
* Add TSDoc to your complex functions
* Comment complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused (DOT principle)

Thank you for helping improve the Shadcn Kanban board! We look forward to your contributions.
